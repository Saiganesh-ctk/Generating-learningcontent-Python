# Generating-learningcontent-Python

In online learning environments, it is difficult to keep students interested. This difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that more and more learning environments are being created by fusing resources from various unrelated sources. In order to do this, we provide an AI-based method that generates supplemental learning material known as narrative fragments, which are inserted into the learning pathways to build interactive learning narratives. The suggested method involves the automatic creation of two different types of narrative fragments: overviews of the learning pathway segments and reflection quizzes or formative evaluations from learning resources in any format.we should extract keywords from the resource using python built-in BERT models. After selecting, we use Maximum Marginal Relevance(MMR) to select the main theme . Get-average-similarity function compares the keywords that has the highest cosine similarity is chosen . Key-phrase-in-allforms function model is used to identify the co- occurring terms of a key phrase and include them in the set .To start with, Pre-trained transformer based Definition Generator is called to generate a definition for a given key-phrase. Finally , Overview is generated using templates , first template is to identify tropical anchors , main theme , definition , meta-data for learning pathways . The second category of templates is for the segments where the learning resources have the same or similar topics. The third category of the template is for the learning resources which do not have generated descriptions/definitions for the main theme . We generate two types of options or distractors â€“ a distractor that is semantically closer to the anchor and a distractor that is syntactically similar to the anchor. This model has a advantage over other existing solutions by finding similarities between keywords which takes less time to generate overview of the learning resources
